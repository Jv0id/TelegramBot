# TelegramBot
Try bot you can by following this link: https://t.me/Custom_gpt_bot
If for some reason you want to try run it by yourself or develop t any futher, you will need OpenAI API,DeepL API, and your own Telegram bot API. 
Do not forget to put them into corresponding classes. OpenAI for Service class, DeepL for Translator class, Telegram bot for Bot class. 
Also, make sure to check libriries used for better understanding: https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots and https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-java. 
For OpenAI I did found any good library, so just used JsonObjects.
More detailed information about how it works you can find in the code comments.
